# credit-risk-classification

* Resources/lending_risk.csv has informatin on lendors and categorization of loans in healthy/high-risk categories

* credit_risk_classification.ipynb creates Logistic Regression Model on this data

    * Following is the evaluation of the model created:
        *   Accuracy of the model at 99.2 % is very high. 
        *   Precision and recall are 100% for healthy loans and 87%,89% resp.  for high risk loan.
        *   So the model is able to predict healthy loans very well but the high risk loans a little less successfully.
        *   However with an overall score of 99% for accuracy,precision and recall, the model does a very good job of         predicting the loans.
